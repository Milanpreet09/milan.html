              <h1 style="background-color: rgb(226, 244, 147);">I am an interesting,fun loving guy with a good sense of humor. One thing about me that is important to know though is that at first I come of as a very shy individualistic guy but once I get to know people and are comfortable with my environment I am great.I am also a very straight and honest person. Academically I am a student who likes to be mentally challenged and I enjoy both hands on projects as well as conventional learning.</h1>  </p>
